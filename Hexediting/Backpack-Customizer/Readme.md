# Introduction
Since I've wanted to get back into programming lately, I've thought about a little standalone tool that allows you to do the hexediting for you and adjust the Backpackslots.

The same functionality will also be added to the FilterTool by LightChaosman.

Note: Since this is an early version, make a backup of your exe, just in case ;)

# How to use
Just put ***both*** files into the same folder your Borderlands2.exe is in.
Then open up the exe and then there are two possible Messages.

1. You haven't had any version of the backpack-edits before and the tool will ask you if it should do the patching for you.
2. You have the first version of the hexedit. The tool will offer you to update it to the second version.

After that, you should be able to adjust the amount of slots accordingly.
Hit the ***Apply*** button to write your changes to the EXE-File.

# Notes
As stated above, this is still an early version. It does not catch any errors yet.
Reverting the patch completely is not an option, yet. As a workaround you should be able to just set it to 0 and hit apply.
