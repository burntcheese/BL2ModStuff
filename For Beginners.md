In this guide I want to show people, that are new to this, how I started and what made this whole process a lot easier for me.

# What you will need

[Unreal Package Decompressor](http://www.gildor.org/downloads)

[UE Explorer](http://eliotvu.com/portfolio/view/21/ue-explorer)


# Step 1

Extract the decompressor and install UE Explorer.

Copy the two files below from ***\Borderlands 2\WillowGame\CookedPCConsole*** into the folder where the ***decompress.exe*** is located.

	* Startup.upk
	* Engine.upk

Just drag them onto the ***decompress.exe*** now and you should now have a new folder called ***unpacked*** in there.

These files are the ones you want to open up in UE Explorer.

# Note: Unfortunately UE Explorer won't show you all objects/classes etc. I'll follow up with a few other methods on how to find more stuff.
